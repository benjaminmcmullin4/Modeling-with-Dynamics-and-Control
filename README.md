# Modeling-with-Dynamics-and-Control
Applied and Computational Mathematics Computer Programming Labs - Volume 4

The GitHub repository dedicated to ACME Volume 4: Dynamic Modeling I encompasses a comprehensive exploration of mathematical modeling, focusing on dynamic systems and partial differential equations (PDEs), along with optimal control theory. The repository serves as a structured guide to understanding and implementing various concepts in dynamic modeling using Python.

The repository is organized into several sections:

Modeling
Introduction to the art and science of mathematical modeling.
Examples of dynamic models, including harmonic motion and population dynamics.
Existence and Uniqueness
Review of ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
Discussion on the existence and uniqueness of solutions to ODEs.
Exploration of homogeneous and non-homogeneous linear systems.
Stability Theory
Study of stability concepts for linear and autonomous systems.
Introduction to Lyapunov's method and Poincare-Bendixson Theorem.
Bifurcation Theory
Explanation of bifurcation and its types.
Exercises to reinforce understanding.
Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)
Introduction to PDEs and their general form.
Classification of second-order PDEs and hyperbolic PDEs.
Study of auxiliary conditions and well-posedness.
Calculus of Variations
Introduction to optimization and the calculus of variations.
Derivation and examples of Euler's equation.
Generalizations of the simplest problem and constraints.
Optimal Control
Introduction to optimal control theory.
Formal derivation of Pontryagin's maximum principle.
Study of different forms of the cost-functional and linear quadratic regulator (LQR).
Control Theory
Discussion on mathematical systems, stability, and linear control theory.
Application of the maximum principle in optimal control problems.
Examples and exercises to solidify understanding.
This repository is a valuable resource for learning and implementing dynamic modeling techniques, PDEs, and optimal control theory using Python.
