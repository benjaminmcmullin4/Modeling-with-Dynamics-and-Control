# Modeling-with-Dynamics-and-Control
Applied and Computational Mathematics Computer Programming Labs - Volume 4

The GitHub repository for ACME Volume 4: Dynamic Modeling I offers a structured approach to understanding mathematical modeling, particularly focusing on dynamic systems and partial differential equations (PDEs), as well as optimal control theory. Organized into distinct sections, the repository starts with an introduction to modeling, covering the fundamentals of mathematical modeling and providing examples of dynamic models like harmonic motion and population dynamics. Moving forward, it delves into the concept of existence and uniqueness, reviewing ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and discussing the conditions under which solutions exist and are unique. The section on stability theory explores stability concepts for both linear and autonomous systems, including Lyapunov's method and the Poincare-Bendixson Theorem.

Bifurcation theory is introduced to explain different types of bifurcations and their implications, accompanied by exercises for reinforcement. The repository then transitions to partial differential equations (PDEs), providing an overview of their general form, classification, and solutions, particularly focusing on hyperbolic PDEs and their applications. Additionally, it covers topics such as auxiliary conditions, well-posedness, and eigenfunction expansions.

The section on the calculus of variations introduces optimization concepts and Euler's equation, gradually expanding to cover generalizations, constraints, and Hamilton's principle. Noether's theorem is also discussed in the context of symmetry and conservation laws. The repository further explores necessary and sufficient conditions for weak and strong extrema, providing insights into optimization problems with constraints and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation.

The latter part of the repository focuses on optimal control theory, starting with an introduction to mathematical systems, stability, and linear control theory. It then progresses to optimal control problems, discussing the maximum principle, different forms of the cost-functional, and the linear quadratic regulator (LQR). Through examples and exercises, learners can deepen their understanding of control theory and its applications in various domains. Overall, the repository serves as a comprehensive resource for learning and implementing dynamic modeling techniques, PDEs, and optimal control theory using Python.
